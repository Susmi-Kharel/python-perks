## Introduction to `unittest`

The `unittest` module is a python's builtin test module. It contains all basics
of software testing, example: test discovery,assertion, setup/teardown, etc.

As python is an Object-oriented programming language, it's `unittest` module
also implements Class-based interface to setup the test module. We can easily
import `unittest` module to start testing our software.

### Example of unittest

The following is a basic example of a testcase which will test for the
correctness of the given function, "reverse_word".

```python
import unittest

def reverse_word(word: str):
    return word[::-1]

class TestReverseWord(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_reverse():
        self.assertEqual(reverse_word("abcde"), "edcba")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## `setUp` and `tearDown` methods

A setup method is a method that runs before each test. The `setUp` method
generally initializes values before testcases are run. For example, If we need
an authorization token to test an API, we can get them in the `setUp` method.

A `tearDown` method is a method that runs after each test. This method is used
as a cleanup method after test gets executed.

An example of setup and teardowm methods are as follows:
```python
```
