Multiple Inheritance.

Multiple inheritance means inheriting the behavior from 2 or more parent classes.

The structure would be

class A:
    <attributes>
    <methods>

class B:
    <attributes>
    <methods>

classs C(A, B):
    <attributes>
    <methods>

- In multiple inheritance, Python uses C3 Linearization algorithm to determine the order in which
  to resolve class attributes and methods. The process is also known as Method Resolution Order (MRO)
