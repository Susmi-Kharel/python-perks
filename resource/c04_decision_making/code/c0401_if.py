If Condition
- It is written with `if` keyword
- all the conditions that are enclosed within the `if` statement are
  indented.
- Unlike other programming languages, it do not need curley brackets
  or braces and might not need brackets for simple logical operations
- to end the statements inside of if condition, we just un-indent it

Syntax
```
if <condition>:
    <statements>
```
"""
# %%
a = 20
b = 25
if a > b:
    print(f'{a} is less than {b}')
print('dummy line')

# %% [markdown]
"""
## If else
- if else condition is same as if condition
- we use else for the condition that does not satisfy the if condition

Structure
```
if <condition>:
    <statements>
else:
    <alternative statements that does not satisfy if condition>
```

## If elif else
- elif contains multiple conditions.
- if previous condition fail and we still need condition in the alternative conditions we can use
  elif.
- we can use any number of elif conditions in python.

Structure
```

    <statements>
elif <alternative condition>:
    <alternative statements that satisfies elif>
else:
    <statements that does not satisfy any of above>
