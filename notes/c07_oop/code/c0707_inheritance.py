# Inheritance
- This concept is exactly similar to biological inheritance where child inherits the feature of parent.
- in inheritance, there exists a parent class and child classes which inherits parent's behaviors.
- The base class will be the parent class and the class that is derived from the base class will
  be treated as a child class.

Basic Structure
class Parent:
    <attributes>
    <methods>

class Child(Parent):
    <attributes>
    <methods>

isinstance()
the method returns True if an object is the instance of the class ir any of the derived classes of a class

here,

Note:
- instance of a parent class is not an instance of a child class
- instance of a child class is also an instance of a parent class since it is inherited from a parent class
