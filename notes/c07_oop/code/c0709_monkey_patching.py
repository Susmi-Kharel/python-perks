Monkey Patching

- it is the process of adding new variable or method to a class after it's been defined
- we can introduce a new instance attribute to an object even after it has been initialized
- monkey patching is useful when we do not want to perform inheritance or create a child class and
  change the behavior of the previously defined classes or previously instantianted objects.

- if we monkey patch the instance attribute, it is not going to change the class template, instead
  it affects only the instance we've created
