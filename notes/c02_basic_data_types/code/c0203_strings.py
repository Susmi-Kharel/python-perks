# We can use Single quote for strings
name = 'John'

# We can use double quotes for strings
name = "John"

# We can use single quotes inside double or vice versa
x = "I am at John's"
x = 'He said, "John is a cool guy!"'

# If we want to have special characters or
# We want single inside single quotes or double quotes inside double quotes, we have to use escape characters

# We can achieve escape characters by using backslash `\` before the character.
x = 'I am at John\'s'  # this will output :  I am at John's

# some of the examples of escape characters and their use cases are as follows:
"""
\t => tabs
\n => new lines
\" => double quotes
\' => single quotes
\\ => backslash
\a => ascii bell
\b => backspace
\r => carriage return
\v => vertical tab
for more detail about escape characters, please see https://docs.python.org
