This section gives you handful projects that not only enhances your coding
skills but adds your analytical thinking too.

**Notes**:
1. Please try to complete all projects as shown in order so that you'd be in
   sync with my tutorials.
2. Try to solve each problems in its own folder.
3. If you need to install any package to complete your project, try creating a
   **virtual environment** for it (Advanced Users Only).
4. Each project requirement is added in a file which explains detailed
   information and expected output of the project._

There are different levels of projects which are targeted to different students
According to expertise. You can start from the **[pilot](#pilot) level** and
advance to the **[Elite](#elite)** level. If you think you're more confident
with one level, you can directly skip to the next level.

## Pilot Projects

Pilot Projects contain all those projects which are targeted to absolute
beginners. It needs basic understanding of programming. A user who is confident
with variables, decision making, loops, and functions can complete pilot
projects. All the projects are console based so the output will be seen in the
terminal.
