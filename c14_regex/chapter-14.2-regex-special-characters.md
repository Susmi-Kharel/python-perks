# 14.2. REGEX Special characters in Regex

There are various special characters in regex which are listed as follows:

## Special Characters

| SN | symbol           | Description                                                             |

|  7 | `{m}`            | Matches exactly `m` number of occurrences                               |
|  8 | `{m,n}`          | Matches `m` to `n` occurrences                                          |
|  9 | `{m,n}?`         | Tries to match as few occurrences as possible but with in range `{m,n}` |
| 10 | `*?`, `+?`, `??` | Tries to match as few occurrences qualified by `*`, `+`, and `?`        |

| 14 | `(...)`          | Matches whatever regular expression is inside parenthesis               |

## Escape Sequences in a regular expression

Regular expression escape sequences not only escapes regular characters but special characters too.
for example if we want to include a character `*` in regular expression, it has it's own meaning which means it needs to
be escaped. by writing `\*`
| SN | Symbol | Description |
| ---: | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | `\A`   | Matches only at the start of the string |
| 2 | `\b`   | Matches the empty string but only ar the beginning or the end of the string. |
| 3 | `B`    | Matches the empty string but only when it is not at the beginning or the end of a word |
| 4 | `\d`   | Matches a number from 0-9 |
| 5 | `\D`   | Matches a character except a number from 0-9 |
| 6 | `\s`   | Matches white space character such as space or tab |
| 7 | `\S`   | Matches a character except white space characters |
| 8 | `\w`   | Matches a character that contains alphanumeric character or `_` character |
| 9 | `\W`   | Matches any character except alphanumeric or `_` character |
| 10 | `\Z`   | Matches only at the end of the string |

## Set of characters in regex

A set of characters in regex are denoted inside a pair of square brackets [].
Unlike special characters in regular regex, special characters (such as `*`, `+`, etc) inside
large brackets has no meaning.

**some of the regex set matches are as follows:**

| SN | Symbol        | Description                                                                         |
|---:|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1 | `[abc]`       | matches either of `a`, `b` or `c`.                                                  |
|  2 | `[a-m]`       | matches either of character from `a` to `m`                                         |
|  3 | `[a-m0-5]`    | matches either of character from `a` to `m` followed by number from `0` to `5`      |
|  4 | `[0-9A-Fa-f]` | matches any hexadecimal character from `0-9` and `a-f` or `A-F`                     |
|  5 | `[^abc]`      | matches either of character except `abc`                                            |
|  6 | `[0123]`      | matches either of `0`, `1`, `2`, or `3`                                             |
|  7 | `[ab][12]`    | matches either of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, or `b2`                                         |
|  8 | `[+*]`        | matches either of `+` or  `*` characters (but no matches for number of occurrences) |

We can also find the number of occurrences of set of characters by specifying `*`, `+` or `?` after brackets.

**For Example:**

- `[0-9A-Fa-f]+` matches any number of occurrences that matches `[0-9A-Fa-f]`. Example: `0`, `1`, `1A`, `ff0c`, etc.
- `[\d]{4}` matches exactly 4 numeric characters from the string.
