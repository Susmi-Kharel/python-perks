A practical number is a positive integer where every smaller can be expressed as
a sum of distinct divisors of that number.

create a number below it.

For example 12 is a practical number.
It's divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.

1 -> 1
2 -> 2
3 -> 3
4 -> 4
5 -> 4 + 1
6 -> 6
7 -> 7 + 1
8 -> 6 + 2
9 -> 6 + 3
10 -> 6 + 4
11 -> 6 + 4 + 1
