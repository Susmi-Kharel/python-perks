# Problem Solving

This section will help us become more proficient with problem solving skills
with Python Programming Language.

This section primarily contains 2 different sections which are as follows:

## Basic Problem Solving

This section helps us warming up with basic problem solving skills. It's goal is
to review our previously learned python notes section.

Some of the Basic Problem Solving solutions are as follows:

1. [Practical Number Solution](basic/practical_number.py)
2. Iteration with Comprehension
3. [Greatest Common Divisor](basic/gcd.py)
4. Matrix Multiplication
5. Median Calculation
6. [Reverse digits of an integer](basic/reverse_digits.py)


## Dynamic Programming

This section helps us solving advanced problems more efficiently and using more
optimum solutions. Solving this type of problem helps us efficiently solve
problems while managing time and space complexity efficiently.

Some of the Dynamic Programming solutions are as follows:

1. [Coin Change Problem](dp/coin_change.py)
2. [Fibonacci Series Problem](dp/fibonacci.py)
3. Palindrome Partition Problem
4. Minimizing the sum of list of integers
5. Longest Common Subsequence Problem
